# Dijkstras Algorithm

Finding the shortest path in a graph from the source to each vertex using Dijkstras algorithm


# Conditions
  - Create a minheap from scratch and store it in an array.
  - Use Adjacency Lists to store the Graph
  - Assume Source vertex to be 1

Sample Input via terminal : 
  Number of Verices\
  Number of Edges\
  Vertex a Vertex b  EdgeWeight\
  


### Compiling and Running

```
make
```

```
./Dijkstras
```
